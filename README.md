# Random Walk Simulations
Random walks are random processes with applications in engineering and science, including modeling the path of molecules, animal foraging behavior and stock price analysis. By analyzing simulations of these random walks the validity of limit laws and the central limit theorem can be established and insight can be gained into their function and behavior.
